`goutils` is a collection of random bits & pieces I've been using across projects.

## Development

This codebase contains a combination of integration and unit tests.

To run all of them in a human-readable way use:

```bash
$ make humantest
```

This requires [richgo](https://github.com/kyoh86/richgo) to be installed.

See the project's `Makefile` for other (more standard) commands.
